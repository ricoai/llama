Llama car is derivative of [DonkeyCar](www.donkeycar.com)

This is a Autonomous RC Car powered by a Raspberry Pi 3 and uses Tensorflow to create an autonomous car that uses neural networks to navigate a race course.

In general this project will teach you to use Neural Networks with Tensorflow and Keras.  It will teach the fundamentals of an autonomous car.  It will also teach you some basic OpenCV to also use computer vision to manipulate the incoming images.
